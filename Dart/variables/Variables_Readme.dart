//A variable is a container for storing data values.
// A variable is  a named location in memory that is used to store data.
// The name of the variable is its identifier. 
//In Dart, an identifier is any valid string of letters, digits, and underscores that does not begin with a digit.
//In Dart, variables are declared using the var keyword.
// If you don’t use the var keyword, then Dart will automatically determine the kind of variable you are declaring.
// In Dart programming language, we use the following rules to declare a variable: 
//In Dart programming language, you declare a variable by specifying its data type followed by the variable’
//s name and then assigning a value to it. For example, int age = 20; declares an integer variable named age with an initial value of 20. 
//The same applies to other data types such as String, double, and bool.
//In Dart, you can also declare a variable without specifying its data type.
// For example, var age = 20; declares a variable named age without specifying its data type.
// Dart will automatically determine the kind of variable you are declaring. 
//The variable name must start with an underscore (_), a letter ($), or any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
// The variable name cannot start with a number. The variable name cannot contain any special characters such as @, #, %, etc.
// The variable name cannot be a reserved keyword in Dart. The variable name cannot contain any white space. 
//The variable name is case-sensitive. For example, age and Age are two different variables. 
//The variable name should be meaningful and descriptive. For example, instead of using a variable name such as x, you should use a variable name such as age. 
//The variable name should be in camel case. For example, instead of using a variable name such as my_age, you should use a variable name such as myAge.
//In Dart, you can also declare a variable without assigning a value to it. For example, int age; declares an integer variable named age without assigning a value to it.
/*You can assign a default value to a variable when it is declared. If no value is assigned to a variable, then it will have a default value of null.
//You can assign a default value to a variable when it is declared. If no value is assigned to a variable, then it will have a default value of null.
/*You can assign a default value to a variable when it is declared. If no value is assigned to a variable, then it will have a default value of null.
//If you need to include a dollar sign ($) in your variable name, enclose the variable name in curly braces. For example, String $name = "John"; declares a string variable named $name with an initial value of John.
//Dart allows you to assign a value to a variable after it has been declared. You can also change the value of a variable after it has been declared. For example, int age = 20; age = 30; assigns a value of 30 to the variable age.
//You can assign a default value to a variable when it is declared. If no value is assigned to a variable, then it will have a default value of null.
//Dart allows you to assign a default value to a variable when it is declared. If no value is assigned to a variable, then it will have a default value of null.

//If you need to include a dollar sign ($) in your variable name, enclose the variable name in curly braces. For example, String $name = "John"; declares a string variable named $name with an initial value of John.
//You can assign a value to a variable at declaration time by including an initializer list after the variable name. For example, int age = 20; declares an integer variable named age with an initial value of 20.
//You can assign a value to a variable when it is declared. To do this, simply include an initializer list after the variable name. For example, int age = 20; declares an integer variable named age with an initial value of 20.
//Dart does not have strict naming conventions like some other languages do. However, it is recommended that you follow common naming conventions for variables. For example, you should use camel case for variable names.
//You can assign a value to a variable when it is declared. This is called initializing a variable. For example, int age = 20; declares an integer variable named age with an initial value of 20.
//If the first character of the variable name is a digit, then it should be prefixed with an underscore (_). For example, int _age = 20; declares an integer variable named _age with an initial value of 20.
//You can assign a value to a variable at declaration time by including an initializer list after the variable name. For example, int age = 20; declares an integer variable named age with an initial value of 20.
