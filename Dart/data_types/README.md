# Learning Objectives

* To understand what data type is
* To understand different data types in DART programming
* Be able to code with the different data types
* A data type is an attribute of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

Dart supports the following data types:

* Number
* Strings
* Boolean
* Lists
* Maps
* Runes
* Null

A primitive data type, also known as a primitive type or fundamental type, refers to the simplest and most basic data types provided by a programming language. These types are not composed of other data types and are typically directly supported by the hardware.

In programming languages, primitive data types are the building blocks for constructing more complex data structures and objects. They are often used to represent basic values such as numbers, characters, and truth values. In Dart, Interger (int) is a primitive data type.
