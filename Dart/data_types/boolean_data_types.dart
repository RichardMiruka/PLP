// In Dart, boolean holds either true or false value.
// You can write the bool keyword to define the boolean data type. 
//You can use boolean if the answer is true or false.

void main() {
  //declaring variables
  bool isMarried = true;
  bool isSingle = false;

  //printing info
  print("isMarried is $isMarried");
  print("isSingle is $isSingle");
}

/*
OUTPUT:
isMarried is true
isSingle is false
*/ 

// In the above example, we have declared two boolean variables isMarried and isSingle.
// The variable "isMarried" has been assigned a value of true and the variable "isSingle" has been assigned a value of false.

// The print statement prints the value of the variables isMarried and isSingle. 
// Since the variable "isMarried" holds a value of true, the output will be "isMarried is true". 
// Similarly, for "isSingle", since it holds a value of false, the output will be "isSingle is false". 
// This is how you can use boolean data types in Dart.
