# assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
# x = 5; # assigns 5 to x and makes x equal to 5
# y += 3; # adds 3 to y and makes y equal to 8. This is equivalent to y = y + 3
# z -= 7; # subtracts 7 from z and makes z equal to 1. This is equivalent to z = z - 7

x = 5; # assigns 5 to x and makes x equal to 5
y = 0; # initializes variable y to 0
y += 3; # adds 3 to y and makes y equal to 3. This is equivalent to y = y + 3

m = 8 # assigns 8 to m and makes m equal to 8
print("m is ", m, "\n") # m is 8
