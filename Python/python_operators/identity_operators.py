# In Python, is and is not being used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory.
# Two equal variables do not imply that they are identical.

# Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. 
# x is y checks whether x and y refer to the same object in memory. If so, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
# They can be represented by "is" and "is not". The identity operator checks whether two variables point to the same memory location.
# The "is" operator checks whether two variables point to the same memory location. If they do, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.   The identity operator is used to compare the memory locations of two objects.
# The "is not" operator checks whether two variables do not point to the same memory location. If they do not, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
# The 'is' operator returns True if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and False otherwise.
# x is y checks whether x and y point to the same object in memory. If so, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
