# Roles of a Project Manager.

Your job as a PM is to deliver business impact by marshaling the resources of your team to identify and solve the most impactful customer problems.
There are three parts to this, each essential:



1. Deliver business impact


Fundamentally, you are responsible for delivering business impact. If your team drives positive impact—hitting important goals, reducing costs, shipping an important project, etc.—you’re doing your job.



2. Marshaling the resources of your team


Your job isn’t to do the building yourself but instead to increase the leverage of your cross-functional teammates—designers, engineers, data scientists, researchers—to deliver impact. As a philosopher said a product manager’s output = the output of their team.



3. Identify and solve the most impactful customer problems


Business impact comes from solving customer problems. Thus, it’s your job to lead your team to correctly identify, prioritize, and solve the most impactful customer problems.

PMs are the ultimate business lever.



Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
—Archimedes


The three core jobs of a product manager
Another way to define the role of a PM is to break out the day-to-day jobs of a product manager:

Shape the product: Harness insights from customers, stakeholders, and data to prioritize and build a product that will have the most impact on the business.﻿
Ship the product: Ship high-quality products on time and free of surprises.
Synchronize the people: Align all stakeholders around one vision, strategy, goal, roadmap, and timeline to avoid wasted time and effort.


All of that is a means to delivering impact.
