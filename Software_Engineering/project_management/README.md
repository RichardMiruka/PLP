Product management is one of the most in-demand roles in technology companies. Yet, it is an often misunderstood role. Product management has a complex history, and the role varies considerably between and within companies.

One common abstraction is to describe Product Managers (PMs) as "CEOs of the Product." This is somewhat true because PMs act as the overall lead and connect various functions like engineering, design, sales, marketing, etc. However, unlike a CEO, companies usually do not roll up to PMs, and there are many stakeholders with equal or greater decision-making authority than a PM. Nevertheless, PMs must provide clear direction and leadership for their products.
