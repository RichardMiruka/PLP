# Often faster than Merge Sort in practice due to less overhead (no need for auxiliary space for merging).
# est for sorting arrays in place.
# Can be inefficient in its worst case, so it's better to implement randomized Quick Sort to avoid worst case scenario.
# Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) but can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case
