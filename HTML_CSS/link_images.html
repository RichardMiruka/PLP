<!--Responsive Images-->
<!--The width and height attributes of an image specify the width and height of the image.-->
<!--If these are not provided, then the browser will not know the size of the image and will not be able to allocate space for it while the page is loading.-->
<!--This can cause the page to jump around as the images load.-->

**<!-- <img src="images/cat_image.jpg" alt ="Description" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;"> -->**

<!--The max-width property is used to make sure the image does not exceed the width of its container.-->
<!--If the image naturally has a smaller width than the container, then the image will not be stretched.-->
<!--However, if the image naturally has a larger width than the container, then the image will be scaled down to fit the container.-->
<!--This is particularly important for ensuring that images don't overflow or break the layout on smaller screens, such as those on mobile devices.-->
