<!--In this example, we have created six internal links to different sections of the same page.-->
<!--Each link has been given a descriptive text to help users understand where the link will take them.-->
<!--When a user clicks on these links, they will be taken to the corresponding section of the page.-->
<!--This feature makes your website easier to use and helps users find the information they need more quickly.-->
<!--Internal links are also useful for search engine optimization (SEO) as they help search engines understand the structure of your website and the relationships between different pages and sections.-->
<!--Note that all URLs must start with "/" to indicate that they are internal links.-->

<!--The id attribute is used to specify a unique ID for an HTML element.-->
<!--This ID can then be used by anchor tags to create internal links to specific sections of a web page.-->
<!--Anchors with the same ID cannot be used more than once on the same page.-->
<!--Here each paragraph starts with an H2 tag and an ID attribute that specifies a unique ID for the section.-->
<!--The anchor tags then use the href attribute to link to the corresponding section using the ID attribute.-->
